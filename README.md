# Workout-Planner

This project will be a way to practice my ReactJS study, after the course I did in Codevolution channel on Youtube.

Basically, this will be firstly a site, that will let you create workout sessions, and then you can use them, using timers or something like that. And the site will use ReactJS, so it'll be a SPW (Single-Page-Website) and in the future can be a SPA (Single-Page-Application), when I learn React Native or maybe Flutter.

## Future Updates
- Pause button while running the exercise plan
- Save plans to access after (BackEnd)
- Sounds
- Bootstrap CSS
